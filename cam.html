        <h3>Critical Analysis of Media</h3>
        <p>CRT is by no means a perfect framework. It has received criticism, primarily coming from Marxists, progressives, and leftists.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>A Marxist would argue that CRT places too much focus on race, undermining class.   
            <ul>
              <li>They'd further claim that policies that aim to redistribute wealth would be more sufficient in solving issues compared to anti-discrimination policies.</li>
            </ul>
           </li>
            <li>Rightists and conservatives have also offered some critique on CRT.
              <ul>
                <li>Their argument revolves around the idea of CRT being unconstitutional in some way, shape or form, typically due to its tenets.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>When approaching these critiques, it is important to be able to determine what is valid criticism versus what is invalid criticism. 
Invalid criticism typically misinterprets CRT, assigning it ideas that don’t align with its tenets. Thus, it is important to critically analyze
        critiques utilizing the tenets of CRT.</p>
        <p>For instance, let's take <a href="https://heritageaction.com/toolkit/rejectcrt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article from Heritage Action for America</a>, a conservative organization. The article
          makes some critiques that don't accurately represent CRT tenets. Let's take a look:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The article claims that <a href="https://heritageaction.com/toolkit/rejectcrt#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20absolute%20truth%E2%80%94only%20competing%20narratives.%20It%20sees%20%E2%80%9Clived%20experiences%E2%80%9D%20as%20mattering%20more%20than%20facts." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
CRT views narratives as more important than absolute facts.</a>
            <ul>
              <li>Referring back to the tenets in the introduction to CRT, we can find that no tenet ever states this; the tenet that this concerns, counternarratives, only 
wishes to challenge dominant narratives to place more emphasis on the experiences of people of color.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The article also claims that <a href="https://heritageaction.com/toolkit/rejectcrt#:~:text=It%20sees%20America%20as%20having%20been%20founded%20on%20the%20system%20of%20capitalism%2C%20which%20is%20racist%2C%20and%20therefore%20must%20be%20disrupted." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRT 
            argues that America’s foundational system being capitalism is inherently racist</a>; CRT never makes such a claim in any of its tenets. CRT claims that racism is embedded in American systems, sure, but not that
          a capitalist system is straight up racist.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In conclusion, the article mischaracterizes CRT and does not accurately describe its tenets. The final takeaway from this all is to ensure critique is valid by first examining whether or not
        they are accurately describing what they are criticizing first. This doesn't just apply to CRT; it is an important skill for any argument.</p>
