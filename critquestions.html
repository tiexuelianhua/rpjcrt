        <h3>Critical Questions</h3>
        <p>CRT serves as a tool to tackle racial inequality in America. Its tenets serve as a way for us to critically examine systems, laws, policies, and institutions, to provide us with new solutions or approaches that encourage unity and promote social justice.</p>
        <p>As we’ve seen in our modern society, social justice comes with a cost. The tenets of CRT imply that to achieve freedom from oppression, the privileged must be willing to make compromises. That leads me to my first critical question: <strong>In what ways can your own identity be seen as privileged? Would you be considered privileged in a different cultural or geographic environment?</strong></p>
        <p>I’ll begin with my own response. In regards to my identity, I am a 20-year old Filipino who was born and raised in the United States, for the most part. I am a straight cisgender male, without any disabilities, and my religion is Catholic. I am currently in my sophomore year of college, and I intend to pursue a computer science major. My family places somewhere in the middle class, but I am able to attend college due to their financial support. Each of these factors 
          have shaped how I've experienced life in some way, shape, or form. Like I said, I am a straight cisgender male, but because I'm Filipino, I am prone to experiencing some level of systemic racism. However, me being in a middle class family that has lived in Washington has provided me with economic stability and a good education, distancing me from the direct impacts of systemic racism. Overall, I would say that I am more privileged than not.</p>
        <p>The parts of my identity that can be seen privileged are my sexual orientation, gender, and place of birth. Furthermore, my lack of disabilities also puts me in a place of privilege. And lastly, my family belonging to the middle class in America would allow me opportunities denied from others. For these reasons, I believe I would be considered privileged in most other cultural or geographic regions.
         To further support my conclusion, I have lived in another country before, and while I have experienced some individual prejudices, such as assumptions about my background, I did not experience any sort of systemic racism that would have denied me opportunities.</p>
        <p>The reason I ask such a question is because CRT tenets place emphasis on the idea of privilege, highlighting its significance to the framework. While CRT originally emerged as an American framework, if our ultimate goal is to stop all forms of oppression, it is valuable to start considering things on a global scale. I hope that this question has allowed you to realize how CRT can be relevant to your own personal life.</p>
        <p>That then leads me to my second question: <strong>In what ways does CRT influence your own academic or career goals?</strong></p>
        <p>Once again, I’ll provide my own response. As stated earlier, I intend on working in the field of computer science. While CRT may be inapplicable to computer science on the surface, there are actually some situations in which it is relevant. For instance, CRT emphasizes the importance of diversity by the counternarrative tenet, amongst others. Thus, it is important to maintain diversity within your own project team, which ensures that your program design accounts for all users. CRT strives for equality, so applying CRT to computer science means that you aim to design technology that anyone can access. Through this, CRT does not remain within the confines of the classroom; it instead informs how I pursue my own academic and career goals in life.</p>
