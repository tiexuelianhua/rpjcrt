        <h3>What is CRT?</h3>
        <p>Critical Race Theory, or CRT for short, is an academic framework that emerged in 1989, originating from Critical Legal Studies (CLS). CLS claimed that the criminal system was based on class, but
        Derrick Bell, one of the founders of CRT, further expounded on the claim by arguing that not only was the system based on class, but also on race.</p>
        <p>CRT examines how race and racism play a role in laws, policies, institutions, and systems. It does this through the use of seven tenets:</p>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 1: Whiteness as a property</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The first tenet of CRT states that whiteness is a form of property, and it is arguably the most important property someone could own. Whiteness is primarily based on one's identity, especially their race. </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 2: Racial intersectionality</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The second tenet of CRT states that race is intertwined with other various parts of your identity. This includes your gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 3: Race as a social construct</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The third tenet of CRT states that race is not something biological; instead, it is a 
concept created by society that serves as a way to classify people. Race isn’t the same as ethnicity; ethnicity refers to a group that 
possesses shared traits, such as culture, religion, or language. </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 4: Racial hierarchy</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The fourth tenet of CRT states that there is a racial hierarchy in America, as mentioned earlier. The racial hierarchy privileges whiteness; whiteness is at the top while blackness is at the bottom.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 5: Interest convergence</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The fifth tenet of CRT states that white society will only practice racial justice to the extent that white society remains in power. In other words, as long as white society remains in power while their interests converge
            with minority groups, they will practice racial justice.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 6: Systemic and systematic racism</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The sixth tenet of CRT explains that systemic and systematic racism are abundant in America. Systemic racism refers to racism deeply embedded in our institutions, policies, laws, and systems.
            Systematic racism refers to the actual carrying out of systemic racism. Both terms are interconnected.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <button class="dropdown-toggle">Tenet 7: Counternarratives</button>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The seventh tenet of CRT refers to narratives belonging to disempowered people. These real-life experiences showcase the actual effects of systemic racism, and are invaluable within the field of CRT.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Since its inception, many notable figures have contributed to CRT. These figures include Dr. David Stovall, a professor who specializes in critical race praxis, which is the practical application of CRT.
        We also have Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term "[racial] intersectionality" and influenced other branches of CRT that have emerged in recent years, such as AsianCrit or LatCrit. Richard Delgado, another founder of CRT,
        championed using counternarratives as a method of fighting against presiding ideologies.</p>
        <p>CRT goes beyond simply examining individual racism, instead looking at the bigger picture and pointing out systemic racism. It can be thought of as a lens to look through, similar to feminist lens or 
        psychoanalytic lens. What is revealed through CRT are the ways inequality may be perpetuated; thus, examining things through a CRT lens allows us to find solutions to social justice issues in order to combat
        oppression and inequality.</p>
